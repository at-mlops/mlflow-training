# MLflow Models & Model Registry

The MLmodel format defines a convention that saves the model in so called “flavors”. 
mlflow.sklearn allows to load mlflow models back into scikit-learn. 
The stored model can be served easily and conveniently using these flavors as a python function either locally, in Docker-based REST servers containers, or on commercial serving platforms like AWS SageMaker or AzureML.
