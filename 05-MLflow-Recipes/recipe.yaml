# `recipe.yaml` is the main configuration file for an MLflow Recipe.
# Required recipe parameters should be defined in this file with either concrete values or
# variables such as {{ INGEST_DATA_LOCATION }}.
#
# Variables must be dereferenced in a profile YAML file, located under `profiles/`.
# See `profiles/local.yaml` for example usage. One may switch among profiles quickly by
# providing a profile name such as `local` in the Recipe object constructor:
# `r = Recipe(profile="local")`
#
# NOTE: All "FIXME::REQUIRED" fields in recipe.yaml and profiles/*.yaml must be set correctly
#       to adapt this template to a specific regression problem. To find all required fields,
#       under the root directory of this recipe, type on a unix-like command line:
#       $> grep "# FIXME::REQUIRED:" recipe.yaml profiles/*.yaml
#
# NOTE: YAML does not support tabs for indentation. Please use spaces and ensure that all YAML
#       files are properly formatted.
