# MLflow Training

## How to do this training?

To participate in follow through this training, follow these steps:

1. Read and set-up your requirements and environment based on the [Prerequisites.md](./Prerequisites.md)
2. Check out the presentation for a shallow but picturesque overview of MLflow: [](./)
3. Deep Dive into technical sessions starting with and overview of Mlflow and how to set up runs and experiments in [01-MLflow-Overview](./01-MLflow-Overview/README-01-overview.md). Each chapter is structured so you go first through a theoretical part in the Markdown file and follow up with a practical session using either the `.py` or `.ipynb` file. In case you are using the notebooks, you probably need to install the requirements to your notebook environment by using `!pip install mlflow` etc. in-line.
4. Follow up by going through the technical part of [02-MLflow-Tracking](./02-MLflow-Tracking/README-02-tracking.md),
5. and [02-MLflow-Models-and-Registry](./03-MLflow-Models-and-Registry/README-03-models-and-registry.md)
6. [04-MLflow-Projects](./04-MLflow-Projects/README-04-projects.md) is mostly a placeholder at the moment and just gives a theoretical overview.
7. End the training by doing a final exercie and apply everything you have learned to a machine learning (or deep learning) example in the [final project](./05-Final-project/README-05-final-project.md)
