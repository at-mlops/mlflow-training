# MLflow Projects

packages data science code in a standard format for a reusable, and reproducible form to share your code with other data scientists or transfer it to production. A project might be a local directory or a Git repository which uses a descriptor file to specify its dependencies and entrypoints. An existing MLflow Project can be also run either locally or from a Git repository.
