# Prerequisites

## Install MLflow

Please install MLflow locally using `pip install MLflow`. Test whether it works by running `mlflow ui` and access the user interface via your browser under `localhost:5000`. In case you are running on Mac, your port 5000 is likely occupied, so you need to run mlflow on another port. Try `mlflow ui -p 5008` for example. Keep in mind you need to adjust your tracking uri as well.

## Clone repository

Please clone the [MLflow training repository](https://github.com/at-mlops/mlflow-training) to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/at-mlops/mlflow-training.git`. For the training itself you can user either a .ipynb or .py files. Please choose your preference and make sure you have a suitable IDE already installed.
