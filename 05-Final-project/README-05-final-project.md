# Final Project

There are two Projects to choose from. Only one is needed to pass the final exercise. Yet, of course you can do both if you are keen on doing so.

Extend the code with everything you know about MLflow now, meaning you track relevant metrics, parameters, further model information & artifacts, and register the model to the Mlflow Registry.
You can also choose to change the code as needed, meaning to calculare further metrics or intend blocks of code. It's up to you. The goal of this exercise is that you make yourself familiar with the MLflow API on a real ML example! Of course, you can choose `mlflow.autolog()` if you are lame and don't want to learn anything. ;)

## Keras | CNN

The first example implements a basic Keras Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset. The example can also be found on the official [keras documentation](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/).

## Scikit | SVM

The second example implements a scikit based Support Vector Machine based on the breast cancer dataset. Its based on a [datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/svm-classification-scikit-learn-python), so if you are itnerested in it you can check it out of course.

## Bonus Exercise

For all of you that got through this exercise at ease check out *MLflow Serving*. It's a part of MLflow Models and allows to package the MLModels to a ready-to-go deployment and even serves it. Check the documentation under [MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/2.5.0/models.html) and look for `mlflow models serve`.
